\section{Updated Goal}

Our goal remains the same. At the minimum, we want to reproduce graphs from sketches in an online configuration as described in \citeauthor{daly2015hand} \cite{daly2015hand} (we are developing the code from scratch). Our ambitious goal is to be able to implement a successful offline version too.\\

\section{Member Roles}

Neeraj: segmentation, Bryan: classification, Debopam: interpretation and training. All of us will work on integrating the subparts into a whole. We use Github to maintain and share data (\href{https://github.com/neerajgangwar/graph-recognition}{Github Repository}). We meet once a week to discuss updates and issues.

\section{Proposed Approach, Data, Initial Results}

Please see Segmentation, Classification and Domain Interpretation sections for extensive details.
