\section{Introduction}

The goal of this project is to replicate the work done in \citeauthor{daly2015hand} \cite{daly2015hand}. We want to reproduce graphs from sketches in an online configuration as described in this paper. We are developing the code from scratch.\\

The recognition process has three main steps - segmentation, classification, and domain interpretation. We have described these steps in their dedicated sections. Segmentation is discussed in section \ref{sec:segmentation}, classification in section \ref{sec:classification}, and the domain interpretation in section \ref{sec:interpretation}.
